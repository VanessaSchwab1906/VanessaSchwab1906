As a former curator, I've always had a passion for integrating innovative tech solutions into exhibitions. I quickly realized the potential to create even more captivating and accessible experiences for visitors by leveraging interactive technologies. Motivated by this vision, I made the decision to expand my skill set and delve into the world of web development, where I could combine my expertise in curation with my fascination for technology. 🖼 👩🏼‍💻💥
